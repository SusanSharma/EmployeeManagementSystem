- ➕ Adding a new employee to the database
- 🔄 Updating an existing employee's information
- ❌ Deleting an employee from the database
- 🔍 Retrieving and displaying a list of all employees


The project serves as a practical example of how to use Java for building a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application with a focus on managing employee records.

## Technology Stack

- 🗄️ JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
- 🗃️ MySQL (or any other relational database)
- 🏗️ DAO (Data Access Object) Design Pattern
